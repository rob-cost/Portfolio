# Personal Portfolio

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple personal portfolio website built to showcase my work, share information about me, and provide an easy way for others to connect. The site includes a curated selection of my latest projects, a short introduction about myself, and links to get in touch or view my code. It is designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.
